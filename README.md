## General Information
This repo contains the source code for a web-based system for facilitating the digital vaccination passport in the first instance in Trinidad and Tobago, and for use by citizens and authorized officials. In an attempt to curb the transmission of the coronavirus, herd immunity through vaccinations is being sought in most countries around the world. With this in mind, a personal record of vaccination status, such as a digital vaccination passport, is a crucial article. The use of a digital vaccination passport is multifaceted. For example, at this time, international travel requirements that mandate the acquisition of a COVID-19 vaccine are being enforced and, while not yet implemented, there is a significant motivation to mandate the same for entry into public facilities such as supermarkets, gyms, schools, etc. Vaccination status can, in the near future, influence mask-wearing and queuing/congregating regulations in these and similar facilities.
